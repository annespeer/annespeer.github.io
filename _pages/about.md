In my research, I draw on an interdisciplinary approach, complementing social psychological research with sociological perspectives and diverse quantitative methods. 

Research on Social Milieus and Social Cohesion
------
To study conflicts and cohesion between groups in society, my colleagues and I have developed a typology of social milieus: the RISC model of social milieus. Social milieus are large, latent groups in society with similarities in their socioeconomic positions and values, or, the 'bubbles' that we live in. [Take a test to determine your milieu membership (German only)](https://fgz-risc-data.de/interaktive-tools/milieu-rechner/).

Research on Status Bias
------
I aim to unpack the complexity of prejudice in the face of socioeconomic inequalities by distinguishing between ingroup bias, a social identity prejudice, and status bias, an inequality prejudice. Whereas numerous social psychological theories focus on ingroup bias, I study to what extent they apply to status bias and status groups.
